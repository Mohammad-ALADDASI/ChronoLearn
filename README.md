## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a **history-based Knowledge Graph (KG)** that can power a **frontend** capable of reasoning, linking, and contextualizing historical information. The system will extract structured knowledge from diverse sources (texts, timelines, archives) to create a semantic network of **events, people, places, and time periods**.

The project bridges **data science**, **NLP**, and **knowledge representation** — providing an intelligent exploration tool for historical research, education, and cultural preservation.

## Research Question

> **How can a history-based Knowledge Graph improve contextual understanding and intelligent information retrieval compared to traditional keyword-based search engines?**

---

## Objectives

* Build a **Knowledge Graph** representing entities and their relationships.
* Design an **ETL/ELT pipeline** for ingesting structured and unstructured  data.
* Integrate **natural language processing (NLP)** for entity extraction and relation identification.
* Implement a **smart query system** for semantic exploration and reasoning.
* Evaluate system performance through query relevance and reasoning accuracy.

---

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection** – Scrape and preprocess texts from open-access archives and APIs.
2. **Entity & Relation Extraction** – Use NLP pipelines for named entity recognition (NER) and dependency parsing.
3. **Knowledge Graph Construction** – Build and populate using RDF/OWL or Neo4j.
4. **Query Interface** – Develop a front-end or command-line interface for semantic search.
5. **Evaluation** – Compare with keyword-based search performance on historical questions.
